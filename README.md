# Unit 3 | Assignment - Py Me Up, Charlie

## Background

This assignment was assigned after 3 classes of python.

It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. Welcome to the world of programming with Python. In this homework assignment, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete **2** Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.
Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation where your newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy. These challenges are far from easy so expect some hard work ahead!

## PyBank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.jpg)

* In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing financial records (`budget_data.csv`) to calculate:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll

![Vote-Counting](Images/Vote_counting.jpg)

* In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process (`election_data.csv`) by calculating:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote

  * As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

    ```text
    Election Results
    -------------------------
    Total Votes: 3521001
    -------------------------
    Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
    Correy: 20.000% (704200)
    Li: 14.000% (492940)
    O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
    -------------------------
    Winner: Khan
    -------------------------
    ```
