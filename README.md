# Unit 3 | PYTHON - Bootcamp Assignment

## Background

This assignment was assigned after 3 classes of python.It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. Welcome to the world of programming with Python. 

Looking back on this assignment, there are a lot of things I would have done differently. Knowing what I know in pandas now I can say that this assignment could have been done a lot simpler. But this post is about my journey! That said.....here is the code I submitted for my assignment having a rudimentary knowledge of python. 

## PyBank

* In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing financial records (`budget_data.csv`) to calculate:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll

* In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process (`election_data.csv`) by calculating:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote
